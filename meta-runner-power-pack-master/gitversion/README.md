GitVersion meta-runner for TeamCity
===================================

This meta-runner allows you to get up and running with [GitVersion](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion) inside of TeamCity without needing to install anything further on your server. It will automatically install GitVersion from Chocolatey after ensuring Chocolatey exists on that server (it installs Chocolatey for you if it's not already there).

GitVersion is the easy way to use semantic versioning (semver.org) with Git. GitVersion uses your git repository branching conventions to determine the current [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/) of your application. It supports [GitFlow](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/GitFlow) and the much simpler [GitHubFlow](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/GitHubFlow) and might work with others (let us know).

Known Issues
------------

1. You can't include spaces in the `execArgs` or `projArgs`
2. While it will fail the build if there is a problem, it won't fail the step (the PowerShell script always returns a 0 exit code unfortunately) so any steps after it that are marked as "Run if all previous steps successful" rather than "Run if build successful" will still run
